# Hacking with watchOS

This is the source code to accompany **Hacking with watchOS**, [a complete tutorial course teaching watchOS development using Swift and SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-watchos).

All the SwiftUI projects should be compatible with Xcode 14 and watchOS 9. Where appropriate, separate project files have been provided so that you can follow the tutorial from scratch without having to dig around in the completed project folder. There are also older WatchKit projects here that have *not* been updated; these are stored for reference only.

Swift Coding Challenges is a book written from the ground up to put your Swift skills to the test. I've written a variety of coding challenges that start off simple but slowly get harder, and it's down to you to solve them. I outline each problem, provide you with sample input and output, add in some hints in case you hit problems, then provide a sample solution and explain how it works.
